Lung Cancer Image Classification

Overview

This project aims to classify lung cancer images using machine learning techniques. The model processes medical images, such as CT scans, to assist in the early detection of lung cancer, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The project makes use of state-of-the-art deep learning models to analyze and classify images effectively.

Features

Deep Learning Model: Implements convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification.

Jupyter Notebook: The entire workflow is provided in a Jupyter notebook for easy experimentation and reproducibility.

Data Visualization: Includes visualization of training, validation performance, and sample image predictions.

Project Structure

lung_cancer_image_classification.ipynb: Main notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

data/: Folder containing the dataset of lung cancer images (not included due to size constraints; see below for instructions on data setup).

models/: Saved trained models for inference or further fine-tuning.

Requirements

To run this project, you need the following libraries:

Python 3.x

TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation)

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of lung CT scan images labeled for cancer detection. Due to its size, the dataset is not included directly in the repository.

To obtain the dataset:

Download the publicly available lung cancer dataset from Kaggle or other trusted sources.

Place the images in the data/ folder.

Update the paths in the notebook to point to your dataset location.

Usage

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lung_cancer_image_classification.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd lung_cancer_image_classification

Open the Jupyter notebook to run the project:

jupyter notebook lung_cancer_image_classification.ipynb

Model Training

The notebook includes all the steps required to train the model:

Data Preprocessing: Load and preprocess images, including resizing and normalization.

Model Definition: Define the architecture of the CNN.

Training: Train the model using the preprocessed dataset.

Evaluation: Evaluate model accuracy on the test dataset.

Visualization: Plot training/validation loss and accuracy.

Results

Achieved an accuracy of approximately X% on the test dataset.

The model effectively distinguishes between cancerous and non-cancerous lung scans.

Next Steps

Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and CNN architectures to improve performance.

Data Augmentation: Introduce more data augmentation techniques to enhance generalizability.

Deployment: Deploy the trained model as a web application using Flask or FastAPI.
