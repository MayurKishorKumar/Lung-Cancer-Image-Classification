# Lung Cancer Image Classification

## Overview

This project aims to classify lung cancer images using machine learning techniques. The model processes medical images, such as CT scans, to assist in the early detection of lung cancer, which is crucial for improving patient outcomes. The project makes use of state-of-the-art deep learning models to analyze and classify images effectively.

## Features

- **Deep Learning Model:** Implements convolutional neural networks (CNN) for image classification.
- **Jupyter Notebook:** The entire workflow is provided in a Jupyter notebook for easy experimentation and reproducibility.
- **Data Visualization:** Includes visualization of training, validation performance, and sample image predictions.

## Project Structure

- **`lung_cancer_image_classification.ipynb`**: Main notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.
- **`data/`**: Folder containing the dataset of lung cancer images (not included due to size constraints; see below for instructions on data setup).
- **`models/`**: Saved trained models for inference or further fine-tuning.
